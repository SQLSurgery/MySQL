To ways to create SSH keys

--Putty
--Terminal

-- Public Key and Private Key. 
-- SSH or Secured Shell is a cryptographic tool used in secure data communication and RSA key is a type of encryption key used in a the RSA algorithm, which is a widely used method for secure data transmission.
-- User would need private key to decrypt when authenticating.


-- Option 1 - Putty
--Download PuttyGen

-- Number of bytes two types 4096 or 2048. The 4096 more stronger as has more bytes. 
-- Use type of key to generate then Generate.
-- Move mouse to generate randomise of key.
-- Key passphrase - extra layer of security for the keys, would be required when authenticating.
-- Save Public and Private Key


-- Option 2 - Terminal

-- Use PowerShell or CMD 

shh-keygen Or 
shh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

/*
-t type of key
-b number of bytes 4096 or 2048 
*/

--Once shh-keygen is run it would give options where to save the keys.
-- File extension with .pub is public and other is the private key. 
-- Can view in code editor tool or notepad to see the generated key. 
-- Share your public key and keep the private key to yourself in secure location, the private key would be used to connect to servers using SSH.
