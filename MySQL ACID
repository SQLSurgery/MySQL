MySQL ACID

ACID is foundational concept for any RDMS guranteeing the reliability of a database system that meets the criteria

Automicity
 - All or nothing 
Conistency of data
 - Database is protected from actions that may corrupt data 
Isolation of actions
 - Multiple actions occuring in parallel will not impact each other 
Durability of data 
 - All committed data is safe

 With various storage engine options in MySQL only Innodb is ACID compliant
  - All transaction statements are stored in memory buffer only committed then written to log and disk. 
  - The binary log and the locking system ensure consistency of the data
  - Locks ensure data integrity by isolating transactions
  - Database changes are recorded in the binary log file providing durability.
